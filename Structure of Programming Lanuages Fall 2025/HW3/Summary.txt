Runner now supports a `watch=<identifier>` command-line option. When this option is used, the watched name is passed into the evaluator so that any assignment to that identifier is reported. Runner also starts a REPL when no file is provided (or when only the watch option is given). In the REPL you can try small snippets, see their results immediately, use `exit` or `quit` to leave, and return an exit code when the program evaluates an `exit` statement.

Evaluator accepts the optional `watched_identifier` and prints a message whenever an assignment targets that identifier. The message includes the variable name, the source location if available (line and column or a position from the AST), and the new value, for example: *** WATCH: 'x' changed at L12:C5 to 7 ***. The evaluator propagates `exit` status up through nested evaluations, including across imports, so the runner can exit with the intended code in both script and REPL modes.

For clearer diagnostics, `ast_to_string()` covers many node types so that messages (such as failed assertions) can show readable expressions. Assertions support an optional explanation; when the assertion fails, that explanation is evaluated and appended to the error message, which makes the failure easier to understand.

Why these changes help

Watching assignments makes it easy to see exactly when a variable changes and where the change happened. The REPL allows quick, incremental testing without creating files, which is useful when tracking down a problem. Reliable exit handling ensures that programs end with the right code, and more readable messages from assertions and AST formatting make errors easier to diagnose.
